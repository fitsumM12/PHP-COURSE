PHP Constants
A constant is an identifier (name) for a simple value. The value cannot be changed during the script.
A valid constant name starts with a letter or underscore (no $ sign before the constant name).
Unlike variables, constants are automatically global across the entire script.

Create a PHP Constant
To create a constant, use the define() function.
Syntax
define(name, value, case-insensitive)
    name: Specifies the name of the constant
    value: Specifies the value of the constant
    case-insensitive: Specifies whether the constant name should be case-insensitive. Default is false

The example below creates a constant with a case-sensitive name:
Example
<?php
define("GREETING", "Welcome to www.youtube.com/ethioprogramming!");
echo GREETING;
?>

The example below creates a constant with a case-insensitive name:
Example
<?php
define("GREETING", "Welcome to www.youtube.com/ethioprogramming!", true);
echo greeting;
?>

Constants are Global
Constants are automatically global and can be used across the entire script.
The example below uses a constant inside a function, even if it is defined outside the function:
Example
<?php
define("GREETING", "Welcome to W3Schools.com!");

function myTest() {
    echo GREETING;
}
 
myTest();
?>
