PHP 5

As per our discussion, Php is a serverside language which means a PHP script is executed on the server, and the simple HTML code which can be interpreated by the browser is sent back to the browser. 

Basic PHP Syntax

A PHP script can be placed anywhere in the document.

A PHP script starts with <?php and ends with ?>:
<?php
// PHP code goes here
?>

The default file extension for PHP files is ".php".
PHP statements end with a semicolon (;).
A PHP file normally contains HTML tags, and some PHP scripting code.

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My first PHP page</h1>

<?php
echo "Hello World!";
?>

</body>
</html>
